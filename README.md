JustTypeCode is a fun little experiment I made to simulate those hacker-style terminals you see in movies. Every key you type spits out a cool line of “code” — no real hacking, just vibes 😎. You can press 1 for manual mode, 2 for auto typing, or 3 to go full RGB hacker-core (it even lets you choose auto/manual once). There’s an animated splash screen at the start (you can skip it with double space), and a blinking cursor for that legit terminal feel.

Everything’s styled with blue-on-black aesthetics, just how we like it. And yeah, I threw in a little watermark and a “🔌 Power the Terminal” button if you wanna support the project (thanks in advance 🙌).
